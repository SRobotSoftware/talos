The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of Prototypical inheritance and its applications within JavaScript, to catalyze better design decisions and facilitate easier, more efficient solutions to programming challenges.

Talos, named for the [Greek mythological figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talos) is an artifical life simulation with some simple critters running around a grid full of plants. All entities on the grid derive from one another somewhere up the chain and the prototypes of each entity can be traced back to a central, base prototype. A live preview of the simulation can be viewed [here](https://zmixon.github.io/talos/).
